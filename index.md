## Welcome to MonkeyDart (MNKY)

This coin at this moment serves NO earthly purpose. Shit-coin's gotta shit.

Seriously. 

This coin is meant as a reminder of the nature of Cryptocurrency Investments at this point in time.

A reminder of how coins with amazing tech can lag behind, while coins with "scientific philosophies" (looking at you, ADA) can flourish.

Life is pain!

MNKY is an ERC20 token. Details below

## Origin Story

## Distribution Info 
There is a set amount of 6,897,114,116 MonkeyDart.
This is "Dart" in ASCII converted to Decimal. 

Me, /u/DrawerPull, will be keeping 30 million MonkeyDarts; 
    10 million to be posted on EtherDelta at time of launch,
    and 20 million to keep in case of needing to replace any 
    MonkeyDarts somebody might have lost due to (not likely) errors
    in the code. Just in case, can't hurt. 

### ICO is ACTIVE
The ICO will last from time of deployment, for three days, until xxx CTS time.

To purchase MonkeyDart through the contract, send Ethereum to the contract address 
    0x...
Also listed below in Contract Info.

The rate for the MonkeyDart ICO is: 
### 0.001 ETH = 10,000 MNKY


IF for some reason, all 6+ billion of MonkeyDart's are purchased during the time of the ICO, 
sending anymore will result in a failure and your ETH (- gas) will be returned to your address.

The same will happen if ETH is sent to the contract AFTER the ICO has ended. 

The status of the ICO will be listed above.

### Free MNKY during first 24hrs of deployment is ACTIVE


To acquire, PM me on reddit at /u/DrawerPull with your ETH address. 

The rules are: **1 ETH address, per account (with 10+ karma)**.

I will send **10,000 MNKY** to each address that is PM'd to my inbox, for the **first 100 accounts**. 

Because I have to pay for gas, this is the limit; unless someone wants to donate some ETH (I will send as much additional free MNKY I can for all ETH someone donates), or can figure out another way to fairly and evenly distribute free MNKY during the first 24hrs of deployment. 

**I will send them as fast as I can, for the first 24 hours.**
